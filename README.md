The file *comet_matplotlib.py* contains two functions replicating the built-in MATLAB functions comet and comet3, in which two and three-dimensional trajectories are represented along time, respectively. The trajectory that the particle leaves behind and the particle istelf at the current time step are visualized through an animation. Example of comet3 output:
